## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There are no libraries necessary to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

The goal of this project was to analyze usersâ€™ interactions with articles on IBM Watson Studio and make recommendations for new articles. The recommendations were based on various approaches including rank based recommendations, user-user based collaborative filtering, and matrix factorization (a Machine Learning technique).


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is one notebook in the repository, Recommendations_with_IBM.ipynb, that goes through the recommendation techniques.  The notebook follows steps set up by Udacity with checkpoints along the way.

The 2 datasets used for the project can be found in the \data folder. The solutions to the questions posed throughout the notebook are given by project_tests.py as well as the .p files.
